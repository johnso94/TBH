Description: An allosaurus.

victory: The allosuarus falls to your feet, dead.

Persuasion: Wait! How on earth did you... nevermind, it breaks the reality of the world if you
think about it too much. Congratulations, your words move the allosaurus to tears
and it leaves you alone.

run: You elude the Allosaurus.

rob: There's nothing to rob on the allosaurus.

death: The allosaurus rips into you and starts eating before you even die.
