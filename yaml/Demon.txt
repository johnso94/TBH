Description: A goblin scout.

victory: As the demon starts melting before your eyes you hear it say, "gniyas si nomed eht tahw suoiruc taht yllaer uoy era, siht 
daer ot emit eht gnikat uoy era yhw" before vanishing altogether.

persuasion: How you convince a demon to leave you alone, I have absolutely no idea but somehow you've done the impossible.
Congatulations!

run: The demon screams to no avail at your fleeing form.

rob: You find some cold brass on the demon which you pocket.

death: As you fall, you see the demon utter an incantation then vanish to wreak havok on the world above.
