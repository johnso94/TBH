Description: A goblin warlord.

victory: Congratulations. With this, Azir should be safe from attacks for the next few months

persuasion: Congratulations! You are able to move the goblin's ire towards the necromancer, The Dark Lord: Master of Death, who has been killing goblins for months now

run: You barely escape from the camp with your life. Next time, you'll have to come more prepared.

rob: On the goblin you find some trinkets to line your pockets with.

death: You fall to the ground, dead, as the goblin motions to some guards to haul your body out of his office.
