Description: A zombie.

victory: The last bit of necromantic energy holding the zombie together fades as it collapes to the ground.

persuasion: You convince the zombie that undeath is just a second chance at life and you send it off to a town to get a respectable job.

run: The zombie feebly tries to follow you but its shambling form is just too slow.

rob: You find a purse the zombie must have been carrying before it died.

death: The zombie leans over and starts eating your corpse.
