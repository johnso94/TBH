    Find out information from the farmers               { Back = Farmlands }     
        -
        The farmers are reluctant to open up to an outsider but you can glean from your interactions that something is going very wrong. Everyone is tense and suspicious and
        everywhere you look you can see families grieving.

            After questioning a couple of families you find a woman who's willing to discuss the matter with you. She tells you that cattle and livestock have been dissappearing for months
            now but no one really paid attention to the issue until four days ago when many people, including her fianc√©e, started dissappearing at a frightening rate. She asks you
            to bring him back or, at the very least, to avenge him.

                -
                Through examining where the people and animials have gone missing, you get a good idea of where the perpetrator is acting from. You track the culprit to a barn that was abandoned after
                its residents were murdered and which the local farmers believe is haunted by their ghosts.

                    As you step inside the barn, you see wisps coalesce and form the image of a ghostly family. The mother stares at you then points to the basement. With this,
                    the wisps begin to fade.

                        -
                        When you open the basement door you are hit by the scent of iron. No ... it's blood. You ready yourself and descend the stairs finding a room littered with the husks of human Corpses.
                        In the middle of the room is a vampire draining the blood from a young man You have no time to react before the vampire, in a frenzy, charges towards you, desperate for more blood. Initiate Combat
