    The Forest of Doubt was once the epicentre of the great empire of Laipiviel. 
    Laipiviel has long since fallen to ruin, however,
    and the forest is now only inhabited by roving goblin warbands.

        During some quick scouting, you notice some locations 
        that might be of interest to you. There is a cave which may
        house treasures of some sort. Nearby
         there's a goblin camp you could farm for experience.

    The River Valley houses the Great River, 
    one of the largest inland rivers people know about. 
    The runoff from the Great River has led to abundant, 
    fertile lands in the neigboring regions and plays a
     large role in the continued economic
    sucess of the kingdom of Azir.

        In the valley you can find several farms and plantations that utilize the river. 
        In addition, you could spend some time around the river and recuperate.

    Find out information from the farmers               { Back = Farmlands, Foreground = Farms.png}     
        -
        The farmers are reluctant to open up to an outsider but you can glean from your interactions that something is going very wrong. Everyone is tense and suspicious and
        everywhere you look you can see families grieving.

            After questioning a couple of families you find a woman who's willing to discuss the matter with you. She tells you that cattle and livestock have been dissappearing for months
            now but no one really paid attention to the issue until four days ago when many people, including her fianc√©e, started dissappearing at a frightening rate. She asks you
            to bring him back or, at the very least, to avenge him.

                -
                Through examining where the people and animials have gone missing, you get a good idea of where the perpetrator is acting from. You track the culprit to a barn that was abandoned after
                its residents were murdered and which the local farmers believe is haunted by their ghosts.    
                -

                    As you step inside the barn, you see wisps coalesce and form the image of a ghostly family. The mother stares at you then points to the basement. With this,
                    the wisps begin to fade.

                        When you open the basement door you are hit by the scent of iron. No ... it's blood. You ready yourself and descend the stairs finding a room littered with the husks of human Corpses.

         farmers believe is haunted by their ghosts.

    Decades ago, when the kingdom and Azir and the Vising were at war,

                Atop a lavishly decorated throne sits a goblin wearing a blue cloak. He launches into a tirade about how he's going to end the world and enslave humanity, though he doesn't explain how he can do both. Overall it's a pretty lackluster speech. It sounds both rehearsed and improvisational with the worst aspects of both. You really get the sense that he's not very good with words or people. After 30 minutes or so, he finally wraps it up and turns to engage you in combat.

    The Tundra is a pretty lifeless place. You won't find much to do here.

    The Vissing Empire has existed for a Millenia and used to dominate most of the Elder Lands. Since the the fey Pallene was killed,
    most of the land near the empire was made desolate, and the empire has been struggling since then. Recently, their situation became even worse when they
    lost control of the Great River during their war with the Azir Kingdom. Since then, their relationship with the Azir Kingdom has improved and, due to trade with the Azir, their economic situation has
    started to improve.

            The Castle is as impressive as you would imagine for a kingdom of this size. Everywhere you look, you find
            objects or paintings demonstrating the extravagence the inhabitants live with. How did you get inside the Castle
            by the way? This should only be open to the royal family and their personal guards. In response to this thought
            a guard nearby notices your presence and moves to block your path. Initiate combat

    The dead forest, once a thriving hub of life, now exists as a warning against hubris. Centuries ago, the forest's guardian Pallene was slain by a human warrior hoping to
    prove himself. His actions angered the land and since then the dead forest and its surrounding regions have been mostly devoid of life.

        Wandering through the forest you see a witch.

            The witch takes no mind of your presence only continuing to stare past you at a long dead tree stump.

    I'm going to be honest here, it's getting pretty late and I just want to wrap up the story part of the game. Can you just pretend that I gave you some
    description of why the Wasteland is the way that it is and go to one of the areas where I put in more work? Thanks.
